<h2> Check out some of the things I've done </h2>

<!-- Wanting alternating colours for the titles for the photos, I used another head h3.  All h2 refers back to the original
CSS styling with the grey background any h3 headers will have lime green backgrounds-->
<!-- Instead of using imgr and getpaint (<-- could not download for some reason), decided to use the resizing tool on my
computer photo gallery and load the images into an images folder on github. All photos were resized to a smaller size-->
<!-- new p class, "imgtext" created so that could centre all of the text for the photos on this page through CSS-->
