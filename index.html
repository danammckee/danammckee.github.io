<h2> Who am  I? </h2>
<p> Well, I am Dinosaur D. Things, nice to meet you. I am a dinosaur and I like doing things. 
With sharpened teeth ready to try the next tasty treat, strangely large hybrid arms (thanks Mum) 
eqipped to reach the top shelf for the best souvenirs, and 
laces tied ready to climb the next mountain, I'm set out to each day to see what I can 
go and do. I am always asked, "What make a Tyrannasaurus rex want to go do things?", and I say back
"There's cool stuff to do out there, why not?" </p>

<article class="row">
  <div class="column1"><h2>Adventures</h2>
  <p> You name it and I'll be there ready to go do it. 
From hiking Angel's Landing in Utah to white water rafting in Squamish, BC 
to seeing the latest Star Wars on opening day, I go and find things to do whether 
it's on the highest peaks, my my own city, or my own living room. </div>
  <div class="column2"><h2>Food</h2>
  <p> Food is a huge part of my daily life and the making of a great day.
Although dino mcnuggets are my at-home go-to, 
I'm willing to try a new food at at least once. Caeser salads with chicken, kale smoothies with chicken, or even an eggplant lasagna with bacon bits. </div>
  <div class="column3"><h2>Next Goals</h2>
  <p>So far, I have done a lot of things in Canada and on the single continent of North America in the U.S.A. and Mexico.  
Looking forward, I am planning on setting sail or jetting off to the other continents of the 
world and continue to try to do things there as well. Bring back Pangaea.</div></article>

<h2> Further Details </h2>
<p> Check out my Photo Album page which is filled with my top favourite things I've done
and a couple of my favourite Locations you should visit and go do some things at. 
Remember friends, get out there and do some things.
