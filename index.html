<h1>Dinosaur D. Things</h1>
<p>Just a dinosaur doing things.</p>

<h2> Who am  I? </h2>
<p> With sharpened teeth ready to try the next tasty treat, 
strangely large hybrid arms to reach the best souvenirs on the top shelf, 
tied laces to climb the tallest mountains, I'm setting out to see what the world has to show me.
I'm always asked, "What Makes a Dinosaur Go on Adventures?" There's cool stuff out there, why not? </p>

<h3> Adventures </h3>
<p> From hiking Angel's Landing in Utah to white water rafting in Squamish, BC 
to seeing the latest Star Wars on opening day, I head out to find adventures on the highest
peaks and within each day. 
</p>

<h3> Food </h3>
<p> Food is a huge part of daily life and the making of a great adventure.
Although meat is my at-home go-to (dino nuggets daily), 
I'm willing to try all the cuisines of the world at least once. Caeser salads with chicken,
 </p>

<h3> Next Goals </h3>
<p> So far, I have been limited to adventures on the single continent of North America.  Looking forward,
 I am planning on jetting off to the other continents of the world. Bring back Pangaea.
</p>

<h3> Further Details </h3>
<p> Check out my Photo Essay page which is filled with my top favourite adventures 
filled with small stories and my Locations page for places I'd highly suggest for you to visit. 
Remember friends, get out there and do some things. </p>
